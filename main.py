    **French and Indian War (1754-1763)**: Fought between Britain and France (with Native American alliances on both sides), it led to British control over much of North America but also set the stage for colonial unrest.
    2. **American Revolution (1775-1783)
    A war between the Thirteen American Colonies and Britain, driven by tensions over taxes, representation, and British control. The colonies gained independence with the Treaty of Paris (1783).
    3. **War of 1812 (1812-1815)**
    Fought between the United States and Britain, partly over maritime rights, impressment of American sailors, and British support of Native American resistance. It ended in a stalemate but boosted U.S. nationalism.
    4. **Mexican-American War (1846-1848)**
    Sparked by territorial disputes after the annexation of Texas, this war resulted in the U.S. acquiring large parts of the Southwest (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo).
    5. **American Civil War (1861-1865)**
    The most devastating conflict in U.S. history, fought between the Northern Union states and the Southern Confederacy. The war was primarily about slavery, states' rights, and economic differences. The Union's victory preserved the United States and ended slavery.
